Empowered AI new recommendation based on profile and history
Here is my First React Natvie app I connected it to news API and the idea is to collect the history in the database, and using openAIAPI to
generate the content the user would like to see. 
I have not finish yet working on it, but the strucutre is here, we got a store, news, and some screen done. 

let me know what you think about it.
